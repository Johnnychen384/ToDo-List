# ToDo-List

Idea from youtuber Andy Sterkowitz
To build a ToDoList that allows us to type in what we need to do to allow us to keep track of what and when we need to do something.
- Ability to add to a list
- Ability to delete content
- A checkmark function to mark finished tasks
- Ability to locally store tasks. So even when you close the broswer, on reopen you will still have list.
